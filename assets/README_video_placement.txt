ASSETS DIRECTORY - Video File Placement
=====================================

Place your k2_logo.mp4 video file in this directory for the landing page.

REQUIRED FILE NAME: k2_logo.mp4

Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (e.g., 1920x1080, 1280x720)
- Duration: Any length (will auto-loop)
- Audio: Optional (will be muted automatically)

IMPORTANT: The file must be named exactly "k2_logo.mp4"

The landing page will specifically look for and load k2_logo.mp4.

If k2_logo.mp4 is not found, the landing page will display a professional fallback UI with a dark gradient background.

For testing purposes, you can download a sample video, rename it to k2_logo.mp4, or create one using any video editing software.

Note: This file can be deleted once you place your k2_logo.mp4 video file.
